Introduction \nInformation technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), are \nrevolutionizing modern education. AI algorithms and educational robots \nare now integral to learning management and training systems, \nproviding support for a wide array of teaching and learning activities \n( Costa et al., 2017; García et al., 2007 ). Numerous applications of AI in \neducation (AIED) have emerged. For example, Khan Academy offers \nKhanmigo, an AI tutor harnessing GPT-4 capabilities, delivering \npersonalized learning support and intelligent feedback across various \nsubjects, including mathematics, programming, and language learning. \nSimilarly, Duolingo, a language learning platform, uses sophisticated AI \nsystems to improve learner experiences ( Bicknell et al., 2023 ). iFlyTek \noffers intelligent assessment systems tailored for va", "meta": {"path": "data\\raw\\AI in Education systematic literature review.pdf", "chunk": 2}}

Second, the distribution of author keywords is \nmore skewed than that of keywords plus. The distribution of author \nkeywords is heavily biased towards the two search keywords, “artificial \nintelligence” and “education”.

Approximately half of the research (45.6 %) centers on \nhigher education, followed by K12 education (32 %) and general edu -\ncation (19.2 %).

It also offers significant opportunities for AIED research. \n5. Discussion \nThis research employs bibliometric analysis and content analysis for \na systematic review of the AIED literature. In the bibliometric analysis, \nthe keywords co-occurrence analysis reveals two sets of concept clusters \nexplored in the literature. The keywords plus co-occurrence network \nhighlights four concept clusters: user behaviors, design science, big data \nanalytics, and AIED impacts. Conversely, the author keywords co- \noccurrence network illustrates concept clusters related to machine \nlearning, educational technology, intelligent systems, emerging tech -\nnologies, and AI education.

For \ninstance, there are clear opportunities for research on the integration of \nthe latest advancements in AI technologies. While our review encom -\npasses a broad spectrum of AIED applications, certain latest de -\nvelopments, such as generative AI, are absent from our sample articles. \nGenerative AI benefits from substantial human involvement for superior \nresults, making it a promising domain for scholarly exploration. Recent \nresearch in AIED has increasingly emphasized the role of humans in AI \napplication design, with a shift toward paradigms that emphasize \nlearner collaboration and leadership ( Andersen et al., 2022; Ouyang & \nJiao, 2021; Xu & Ouyang, 2022 ).

In our review, AIED ethical studies did not emerge as a \nmajor research theme in the keyword co-occurrence analysis and con -\ntent analysis. However, some ethics concerns have been generally dis -\ncussed in “ challenges of AIED ” . The increasing integration of AI \ntechnologies in education has led to growing ethical risks and concerns, \nincluding issues related to personal data privacy, algorithm biases, and \nlearner and educator autonomy ( Akgun & Greenhow, 2022; Boulay, \n2023; Wells, 2023 ).

Moreover, \nover half of the empirical studies in the AIED field do not integrate any \ntheoretical frameworks into their research development.

Introduction\nThe rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various sectors,\nand education is no exception. AI plays a significant role in both general and higher educa-\ntion, influencing students’ academic development by offering a mix of opportunities and\nchallenges (Edtech, 2020). From personalized learning experiences to intelligent tutoring\nsystems that provide tailored guidance, support, and feedback based on individual learning\npatterns and knowledge levels (Hwang et al., 2020), AI has the potential to revolution-\nize education (Holmes et al., 2019) and address the diverse needs of learners.

The integration\nof AI in academic environments raises critical questions related to equity, accessibility,\nand the evolving role of traditional teaching methods. The influence of AI on education\nis transformative and multifaceted. AI enables personalized learning by adapting educa-\ntional content to meet the unique needs of individual students (Hennekeuser et al., 2024).\nStudies have shown that students in personalized learning environments exhibit improved\nself-efficacy and a more positive attitude toward their education (Johnson & Smith, 2019).\nThese experiences are increasingly achievable through AI-driven tools that analyze vast\namounts of data to identify learning gaps and tailor interventions accordingly (J. A. Baker,\n2021). For instance, AI-powered platforms, such as adaptive learning systems, have been\nshown to enhance student engagement and performance by providing real-time feedback\nand customized learning pathways (Luckin et al., 2016; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).\nIn traditional education, students are encouraged to take an active role in their lear", "meta": {"path": "data\\raw\\The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Students’ Academic Development.pdf", "chunk": 4}}

Critical thinking\nskills are essential for shaping students’ overall learning experiences. Educators often rely\non questioning techniques, collaborative activities, and assignments to enhance students’\nability to evaluate information and develop independent perspectives (Facione, 2020).\nHowever, the rapid information processing and insightful responses provided by AI\nchallenge traditional learning methods, raising questions about the distinctions between\nhuman learning and machine-based learning. For example, while AI can efficiently process\nand analyze data, it may lack the nuanced understanding and creativity inherent in human\ncognition (Luckin et al., 2016). This underscores the need for a balanced approach to AI\nintegration, ensuring that it complements rather than replaces human interaction and the\ndevelopment of critical thinking skills (Wu, 2023).\nThe use of AI in education is not without its challe", "meta": {"path": "data\\raw\\The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Students’ Academic Development.pdf", "chunk": 5}}

The effective integration of\nartificial intelligence in education requires a thorough understanding of both the technology\nand the learning process. This complexity is further heightened by ethical concerns, espe-\ncially in the context of the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence. For instance,\nQadir (2023) highlights the risk of students misusing AI tools in dishonest or unautho-\nrized ways, such as using AI-generated content to complete assignments without proper\nattribution. Additionally, concerns about the application of AI in surveillance, control,\nand assessment practices could undermine trust and autonomy in educational settings\n(Williamson, 2017). Higher education institutions must clearly define the role and extent of\nAI in student education to address these challenges effectively (Holmes & Tuomi, 2022).\nAs data processing and computing technologies have evolved, artificial intelligence\n(AI) has been increasingly applied in the educational field, often ref", "meta": {"path": "data\\raw\\The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Students’ Academic Development.pdf", "chunk": 6}}
