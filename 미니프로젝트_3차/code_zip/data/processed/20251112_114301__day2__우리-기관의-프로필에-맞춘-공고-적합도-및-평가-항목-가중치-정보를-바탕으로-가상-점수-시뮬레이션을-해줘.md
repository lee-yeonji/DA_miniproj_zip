- le-choice questions (Items 2 and 7), and Likert scale questions (Items 3 and 5), enabling both categorical and ordinal data analysis. Educ. Sci. 2025, 15, 343 4 of 12 2.3. Analysis Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, including frequency and percentage calculations, to provide a clear overview of students’ percep- tions, usage patterns, and the perceived effectiveness of AI tools. For the qualitative data, responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis, a well- established and rigorous method for interpreting qualitative data. The thematic analysis followed the framework proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006), ensuring a systematic and transparent approach to identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within the data. The analysis was conducted at two levels as follows: vertical analysis, which focused on individual responses to identify unique insights; and horizontal analysis, which ex- amined patterns across the entire dataset to ensure a comprehensive understanding of emerging themes.
