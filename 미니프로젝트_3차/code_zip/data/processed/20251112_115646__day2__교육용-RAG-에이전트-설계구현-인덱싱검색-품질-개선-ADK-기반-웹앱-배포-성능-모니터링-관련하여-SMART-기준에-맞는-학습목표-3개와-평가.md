핵심 근거 요약:
- trees ( Lin et al., 2013 ). These algorithms analyze and identify students ’  learning styles within an e-learning system, enabling adaptive adjust - ments to content presentation according to individual preferences. For  instance, in the UZWEBMAT system designed by  ¨ Ozyurt et al. (2013) ,  learning objects were tailored in three distinct ways to align with visu - al – auditory – kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles ( Fleming, 2001 ) for each  subject. Lo et al. (2012) crafted an adaptive web-based system featuring  an adaptive network interface that aligns with students ’ cognitive styles.  Additionally, AHLS offer students guidance and navigation assis - tance to expedite the discovery of learning materials or recommend the  most effective learning pathways. These pathways can adhere to the  originally planned learning path ( Lin et al., 2013 ) or offer remedial  paths for corrective learning ( Hsieh et al., 2013 ). This adaptability  empowers students to navigate their learning experiences more  effectively.  4.2.1.2. Intelligent assessment and management applications.
